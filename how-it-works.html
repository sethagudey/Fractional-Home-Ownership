    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>
      A transparent, step-by-step model for fractional real estate ownership
      powered by blockchain technology.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 1 -->
  <section>
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="section-title">
        <h2>1. Asset Selection & Due Diligence</h2>
        <p>Only quality, vetted properties are onboarded.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        We identify real estate assets with strong fundamentals and conduct
        legal, financial, and operational due diligence. This ensures that
        each property meets predefined standards before being made available
        for fractional ownership.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Step 2 -->
  <section>
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="section-title">
        <h2>2. Tokenization</h2>
        <p>Real-world assets meet blockchain infrastructure.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Approved properties are digitally represented on the blockchain and
        divided into a fixed number of fractions. Each fraction reflects
        proportional ownership rights, enforced by smart contracts.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Step 3 -->
  <section>
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="section-title">
        <h2>3. Fractional Ownership</h2>
        <p>Accessible investment for global participants.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Investors acquire fractions rather than entire properties, reducing
        capital requirements while enabling diversified exposure across
        multiple assets.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Step 4 -->
  <section>
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="section-title">
        <h2>4. Revenue & Performance Tracking</h2>
        <p>Transparent ownership and income distribution.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Rental income, performance metrics, and ownership records are tracked
        transparently. Smart contracts automate revenue distribution according
        to each investor’s fractional ownership.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Step 5 -->
  <section>
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="section-title">
        <h2>5. Long-Term Growth</h2>
        <p>Building liquidity and expanding access.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Over time, we aim to enable improved liquidity, secondary transfers,
        and expanded asset offerings, creating a sustainable ecosystem for
        fractional real estate ownership.
